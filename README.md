# VeriQuant Website

VeriQuant is building AI agents for automated mathematical verification in quantitative finance. This website showcases our technology and gathers market demand evidence.

## Environment Setup

1. Copy the environment template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get your Web3Forms access key:
   - Go to [https://web3forms.com](https://web3forms.com)
   - Sign up with `jason@veriquant.co`
   - Get your access key from the dashboard
   - Replace `your_actual_access_key_here` in `.env` with your real key

3. The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` so your key won't be committed to GitHub

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is already configured in this repo, so you can start using it without any installation.
